		<p><b>Introduction</b>
		<p>Doremon is the one of the main characters in the Doraemon comic series, written by Fujiko F Fujio. He was a household robot produced in the 22nd century.
			Nobita's great-grandson sent Doremon back in time to help Nobita, because the Nobi family has been in big debt due to Nobita's extravagance. Consequently,
			Doremon became the best friend of Nobita and frequently help him with his future gears.

			<ul style = "square">
				<li>Infinite gear inventory: Doremon has an infinite pocket in front of his belly. He used it to store high-tech gears that are produced in the
					future to make humans' life easier. With the gears, Doremon helped Nobita with his daily life, as well as joining numerous adventures with 
					the group.</li>
				<li>Afraid of rats: Even though Doremon was designed as a cat, he was afraid of rats, one of which bit off his ears when he slept.</li>
			</ul>
		<p><b>Possible Ending</b>
			<p>The author never finished the series. As a result, a group of fan has theorized an ending which was widely accepted:
			<p>Doraemon ran out of battery. Because he has lost his ears, which normally store back-up data, replacing the battery would delete all of his memory.
				As a result, Nobita decided to leave Doremon in a dormant state, waiting for innovation to fix him. Eventually, Nobita became a leading engineers and 
				replaced Doremon's battery. Doremon wake up, and the series end with his usual line: "Stop sleeping, Nobita! You need to do the homework!"

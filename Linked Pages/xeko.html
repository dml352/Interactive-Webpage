		<p><b>Possible Ending</b>

			<p>As Doremon ran out of battery, Nobita apparently hid his friends the truth and simply told them Doremon has departed for the future. 
				In the future, Xeko became a successful businessman (apparently taking over the family businesses). When Nobita was interviewed after 
				his break-through technology, Dekhi, the president and another of their childhood friend, revealed that Doremon was still alive. Dekhi has
				also prevented every interference from the future, so that Nobita would be determine to become a scientist and create the technology that
				the world need.

		<p><b>Introduction</b>
		<p>Nobita is the one of the main characters in the Doraemon comic series, written by Fujiko F Fujio. He was a student with low grades and weak body,
			who was frequently bullied by Chaien and Xeko. At the start of the series, he met and befriended with Doraemon, who became his best friend.
			Nobita was a very kind person, and his creativity is evident during the group's adventures.

			<ul style = "square">
				<li>Shooting: Even though he has to wear glasses all the time, Nobita is an exceptional shooter. He was able to defeated two cowboys 
					in one short story.</li>
				<li>Learning potential: Nobita frequently procrastinated his homework and preferred sleeping. However, he earned exceptional results when he

		<p><b>Possible Ending</b>
			<p>The author never finished the series. As a result, a group of fan has theorized an ending which was widely accepted:
			<p>Doraemon ran out of battery. Because he has lost his ears, which normally store back-up data, replacing the battery would delete all of his memory.
				Because Nobita don't want to lose their friendship, he started learning hard. Eventually, Nobita became a leading engineers in the world, and he 
				was able to replace Doraemon's battery without deleting his memory.
